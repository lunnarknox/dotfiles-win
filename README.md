# dotfiles-win
This repository hosts my personalized configuration files (dotfiles) and automation scripts for Windows 10. The goal is to centralize and version my development environment setups, making it easy to replicate on new machines or recover after reinstalls. It focuses on dev tools, productivity, and Windows customization.
